# Examples

This folder contains GNU Radio Companion (GRC) flowgraphs that demonstrate the BLE decoder in action.

The examples use pre-recorded 124-byte BLE packets captured with a Pluto SDR from a Nordic Semiconductor nRF board. They showcase how the decoder processes real BLE signals and extracts the payload.

The flowgraphs are designed for offline use with recorded data but can be adapted for live reception with a Pluto SDR.
